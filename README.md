# Tic Tac Toe Game in Pygame

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using the Pygame library in Python. The game can be played by two players who take turns marking a 3x3 board with their respective symbols (X or O) until one of the players gets three in a row.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website

You will also need to install the Pygame library. You can do this by running the following command:

```
pip install pygame
```

### Installing

To get started, you can clone the project repository from GitHub:

```
gh repo clone assem449/TicTacToeGame
```

## Running the Game

Navigate to the project directory: Once Pygame is installed, navigate to the directory containing the game files using the terminal.

Run the game: Run the game by running the TicTacToe.py file. 
To do this, enter the following command python in the terminal:

## How to Play

The game can be played by two players. Player 1 uses the X symbol, while Player 2 uses the O symbol.

If you want to start a new game, simply type in the cosole "Yes"/"Y"/"y", if not type "No"/"N"/"n".
